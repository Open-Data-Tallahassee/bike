## How to Upload a Bike Route:
1. Create an account with Github.com. It takes just a minute to sign up. You need an account to upload a route.
2. Once you're signed up and signed in, go to this [link](https://github.com/Open-Data-Tallahassee/bike/upload/main)
3. Upload your route(s) with any of the following extensions: .gpx, .kml, .json, or .geojson. We *prefer* geojson, but will take whatever format you have.
4. Under 'Commit your changes': 
  - In the first box, briefly share what you uploaded (example: bike route for Lafayette Park to Levy Park)
  - In the second, share more details about the route, like how comfortable it is or how noisy. 
5. You're almost done! This step is **very important**: click the second, NOT FIRST, radio button. The one that says "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". When you click it, an input box will appear. Enter a name for the branch. The name can be whatever you want, like "route-for-lafayette-to-levy". When you make a new branch, it allows us to review the route before it gets added to the bike route list.
6. Now you're done! Click 'Propose changes'.
