## How to Upload a Bike Route:
1. Create an account with Github.com. It takes just a minute to sign up. You need an account to upload a route.
2. Once you're signed up and signed in, go to this [link](https://github.com/Open-Data-Tallahassee/bike/upload/main)
3. Upload your route(s) with any of the following extensions: .gpx, .kml, or .geojson. We *prefer* geojson, but will take whatever format you have.
4. Under 'Commit your changes': 
  1. In the first box, briefly share what you uploaded (example: bike route for Lafayette Park to Levy Park)
  2. In the second, share more details about the route, like how comfortable it is or how noisy. 
5. You're almost done! This step is **very important**: click the second, NOT FIRST, radio button. The one that says "Create a new branch for this commit and start a pull request". When you click it, an input box will appear. Enter a name for the branch. The name could be whatever you want, like "route-for-lafayette-to-levy". When you make a new branch, it allows us to review the route before it gets added to the bike route list.
6. Now you're done! Click 'Propose changes'.
